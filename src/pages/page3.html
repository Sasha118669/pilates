<h2>1. Pilates is good for everyone</h2>
<div class="paragraph"> 
   <p> The great thing about Pilates – and especially equipment Pilates – is that it can be easily modified. This means that Pilates can be safely practised by pretty much everyone.
</p>
   <p> Using the support of the equipment, Pilates exercises can be broken down so that they become achievable for beginners or people who are returning to exercise following injury or illness. At the same time, the addition (or removal) of a few springs on a machine can make movements more challenging for people who have been practising Pilates for a while or for those who are looking to improve their sports or fitness performance.
    </p>
    <p>Pilates exercises performed both on the mat or with machines can be made suitable for pregnant women, and the support of the equipment also makes it a safe and effective form of exercise for older adults.
    </p>
    <p>All of this means that (with the guidance of a good instructor) Pilates can be practised at all stages of life.

<h2>2. Pilates improves sports performance</h2>
<div class="paragraph"> 
   <p> Dancers and elite sports men and women have benefitted from the Pilates method since it was first invented back in the 1920s.
</p>
   <p> Since then, however, Pilates has become the go-to for fitness fanatics or people playing recreational sports looking to improve their game, for injury prevention and for rehab. And, as many have discovered, you don’t have to be a professional to reap the benefits of Pilates’s game-enhancing properties.
    </p>
    <p>Tennis players (of any standard) can benefit from Pilates. As can people who do triathlons for fun and football after work. Pilates is also an effective way to support your body if you’re a fan of weight-lifting at the gym or running.
    </p>
    <p>After all, Pilates is all about efficiency of movement, creating balanced muscles, and improving mobility in the spine and elsewhere – and these are things all fitness enthusiasts can benefit from.

<h2>3. Pilates improves balance</h2>
<div class="paragraph"> 
   <p> If you’ve ever tried Pilates then you’ll know that certain movements really challenge your balance – and none more so than the side splits performed on a moving reformer platform on a light spring or lunging on the chair with no handles.
</p>
   <p> Dynamic exercises like these help to improve the efficiency of the body’s deep stabilising muscles. Through regularly practising these kinds of movements, you can also develop better coordination and balance.
    </p>
    <p>Balance, coordination and stability are skills everyone can benefit from having, from sports professionals to desk workers. For athletes like tennis players, for example, developing better balance through Pilates can help them keep upright after having hit a ball when twisting and on one leg.
    </p>
    <p>Developing these skills can be especially beneficial for older people including those with osteoporosis or at a high risk of falls. Studies have consistently shown that Pilates is an effective form of exercise to improve balance in older adults. Furthermore, Pilates has been shown to have a positive effect on balance and function for those with neurological conditions such as Parkinson’s Disease.
