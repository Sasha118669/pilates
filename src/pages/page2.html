    <h2> What is Pilates?</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
        If you’re wondering if Pilates is good for you then it’s likely that you’re new to Pilates and you may not even really know what it is! While the popularity of Pilates has increased in recent years, this method of exercise has been around for decades.
        </p>
       <p> Originally developed by Joseph Pilates to improve his own health, Pilates began as a form of exercise that combined the philosophies of mental focus, breathing and physical movement. 
        </p>
       <p> The style of movement we are familiar with today really started to take shape in the 1920s, when Joseph and his wife immigrated to New York and set up their first studio. By the 1960s, Pilates was a favoured method of exercise training for New York Ballet dancers, and by the 1980s it became a mainstream form of exercise. 
        </p>
       <p> Today, there are a number of different Pilates schools that each teach a variation of the original method while all remaining true to the six original Pilates principles (Breath, Concentration, Control, Precision, Centre and Flow). <br>
        </p>
       <p> Pilates exercises can be performed on the mat or using Pilates Equipment such as the reformer, trapeze table, wunda chair and ladder barrel. While you can certainly expect to engage and challenge your core during a Pilates exercise class, you’ll also find yourself challenging your strength, stability and control, balance, coordination and mobility.

    <h2>1. Pilates is good for spine health</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
Spinal fluid lubricates the discs and vertebrae of the spinal column. This is what keeps the spine healthy. When these discs dry out (due to old age, illness or injury), an achy and stiff back and restricted movement can be the consequence.
</p>
<p>Twisting movements can help combat this dryness. Twisting lubricates the spine and therefore keeps discs plump and healthy.
</p>
<p> Pilates is famous for the way it twists and turns the spine in all directions. “Spine twist”, a movement that is performed on the mat, is just one example of the many rotating, twisting and spine-turning exercises you’ll find performed in a Pilates class.
</p>
 <p>Movement of the spine in all directions also helps mobilise the joints of the spine and keep the muscles that attach to the spine moving freely. Pilates exercises also focus on deep core and spinal strength and control. This helps provide support to the spine during loading activities like running, but also helps us in sustained postures like sitting at a desk all day.
</p>
<p> And exercises like these are what make practising Pilates regularly a good way of keeping your spine healthy.

    <h2>2. Pilates improves circulation</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
 Deep breathing and good posture improve circulation. And Pilates focuses on both things.
</p>
 <p>As we’ve already mentioned, Pilates exercises strengthen the postural muscles and improve spine mobility to create good posture. This improves circulation by helping the blood to flow more easily around the body.
</p>
 <p>On top of that, people who practise Pilates regularly develop good breathing habits through learning to inhale and exhale fully (most of the time we breathe shallowly and in our chests).
</p>
 <p>This is achieved through bringing attention to the breath and by using it in a conscious way when performing certain exercises.
</p>
 <p>Other techniques, like diaphragm and abdominal release, which are more common in Pilates sessions, also help people access better movement of their ribs and diaphragm, and this also leads to deeper breathing.
</p>
 <p>All of this supports good circulation because deep breathing encourages blood to flow to the chest and the heart.

    <h2>3. Pilates helps with lymphatic drainage</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
 Our lymphatic system is an important part of our immune system. It’s basically our body’s way of disposing of the waste products produced by our cells.
</p>
 <p>This cellular waste product is carried in the lymph fluid – a fluid that is similar to blood. The lymphatic drainage system contains millions of vessels and flows around the body. Unlike blood, however, which has the heart to pump it around the body, lymph requires breathing, movement of muscles and the flow of intestinal fluids to stimulate its flow.
</p>
 <p>Getting the lymph fluid flowing freely around the body is essential as this is how toxins reach the lymph nodes and are expelled from the body.
</p>
 <p>Pilates is great for stimulating lymphatic flow because it gets the body twisting and turning in all planes and orientations. Pilates also focuses on moving and mobilising joints which is particularly useful when it comes to lymphatic movement and detoxification because most of these lymph nodes are found at joints.
</p>
 <p>Pilates inversion exercises can be a great way of encouraging lymphatic flow from the legs, since many of these exercises raise the legs above the body. When the legs are elevated this encourages flow back to the lymph drainage nodes at the hips.
</p>
 <p>It seems that Joseph Pilates (the man who invented Pilates) knew what he was saying when he described Pilates as a “cleaning” system for the body.
